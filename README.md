This is the anticipated project!!! The simple shell... quite simple when you understand it...

Project between the great

Olaguru (out tutor master)

and

My humble self Oladapsy.

This project took a month to finish, even though the checker was misbehaving

Explanation:
we all know the parameter to handle can't be more than 80 character because
of betty... so for this reason, a struct was used and this variables were
declared using the struct... after which the variables were asigned to each
parameter needed to solve the shell... eg.. argc argv issatty and so on..

the code could as well be written in a program but instead it was truncated to
47 functions which made it pass betty and easier to carry out
The function used are:
1. the usual strcat function: this function helps us to concatenate two strings
2. the strcpy function: this function is used to copy two strings, this will be useful
	when dealing with envs 
3. the strlen function: this will give the total length of a string... including the null
	thi will be useful in so many ways and as we define it, it will make the code of the
	main shorter and we could just xall it whenever we want to use it...
3. the strdup: we al know what the sting dup function does... we ill ue all this string function
	 since we cant use them in the string file.
4. the putchar/writecharacter: the function will be used to print a character to the standard output
5. the atoi function: this function converts a string to an integer
6. The realloc function, to reallocate memory.
7. The strcmp function: this function is useed to compare two strings to see if
	they are the same.... as you can see... this will be very useful for our function
8. The function tokenize_word or _tokenize: this function collects a word and a delimeter
	and it tokenizez it using the help of strtok and som string function
